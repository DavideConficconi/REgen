# Regular Expression Generator

Authors: Angelo Borsotti

This program contains the implementation the RE benchmark generation.

Generation:

    The program has been developed with Oracle jdk 1.8.

    javac -encoding UTF8  REgen.java
    javac -encoding UTF8  REgenMain.java

Installation:

    There is no need to install it, the program can be run directly from a command prompt.

Run:

    - generate the corpus of REs and texts (strings)
    
    - run: java -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 -Xmx1200m -Xss10m  REgenMain <benchmark>

Tailoring:

    - REgenMain.java contains an example of benchmark generation. You can tailor it to
      fit the generation of your specific benchmark:

        - change the class MyEmitter, by providing some implementation of the methods
          in it that allow you to store - in whatever way you need - the REs and texts

        - set the parameters to the values that best represent the characteristics
          of your use case

    - compile and run REgenMain.java
